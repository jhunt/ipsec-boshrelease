    description: |
      Enable additional, more verbose debugging and logging options on
      various components, to aid in debugging and diagnostic efforts.

  timeout:
    default: 30
    description: |
      How long (in seconds) to wait for the IPsec subsytem (notable, the
      charon daemon) to start up, during BOSH pre-start.

  ca:
    default: []
    description: |
      A list of PEM-encoded X.509 Certificate Authority certificates that
      will be used as the basis for PKI in IPsec.

  keypairs:
    description: |
      A map of certificate / keypairs, indexed by _internal_ name, which
      will be used to reference them from the `encrypted` property.

      The keypair named "default" will be used on all encrypted
      configurations that do not explictly specify a keypair.

      Each entry in the list must have two YAML keys: `certificate` and
      `key`, supplying the PEM-encoded X.509 certificate and PEM-encoded
      private key, respectively.

  encrypted:
    default: []
    description: |
      A list of subnets or hosts that are participating in encrypted IPsec
      communications.  Packets to and from these hosts / subnets will be
      encrypted, and validated.

      Each entry in the list is an object (map) with the following keys:

        - `net` or `host` - A subnet (ip/cdir) or host IP to restrict the
          scope of encryption traffic too.  This must be lexically unique.
          If you specify a `host` with a `/cidr` mask, the release will
          raise an error and refuse to deploy.

        - `keypair` - The name of the certificate / private key pair, from
          the `keypairs` job property.  If not specified, "default" is
          assumed.

        - `options` - Another object (map) that provides advanced
          configuration directives for `ipsec.conf`; use these with
          **GREAT** care, as they have the potential to break your setup in
          new and interesting ways otherwise.

          By default, `options` is assumed to be the following:

              auto:        route
              type:        transport
              keyexchange: ike
              esp:         aes128gcm16!
              ike:         aes128-sha256-modp2048!
              mobike:      no
              dpdaction:   restart
              dpdtimeout:  10s
              dpddelay:    10s

          and overrides in-manifest are done key-wise (allowing you to, for
          example, override just `dpddelay` without having to supply all the
          other defaults.

  cleartext:
    default: []

      A list of subnets or hosts that are *NOT* participating in encrypted
      IPsec communications.  Packets to and from these hosts / subnets will
      *NOT* be encrypted or validated.
