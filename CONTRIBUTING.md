change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with

## Issue Submission Process

1. Please be as detailed as you can be when reporting issues.

2. If possible, provide BOSH manifests that we can use to
   reproduce your issue.  You are encouraged to redact any
   sensitive information, including network addresses, usernames,
   passwords, etc.

3. Please be patient; sometimes we lose track of issues in GitHub.
   If you feel that your issue has been forgotten, please post an
   update to trigger a new notifications (but please don't abuse
   notifications).


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that existing example BOSH manifests still work; they
   are intentionally lightweight, but not overly simplistic.
   Together, they provide executable versions of common use cases.

2. New BOSH manifest job properties, or changes to user-visible
   behavior of existing properties, **must** be accompanied by
   documentation changes detailing the new behavior, and any
   deviation from previous behaviors.

3. All commits must be `Signed-off:` as proof of _Developer's
   Certificate of Origin_ (see below).  This is to protect our
   ability to legally accept and redistribute your changes.

4. After review and approval, your pull request will be merged by
   a repository owner or project maintainer.

5. Not all pull requests will be merged.
